# ECoG-Driven-MuJoCo-Arm-Control-with-Deep-Learning
A project exploring real-time brain-computer interface (BCI) for robotic arm control using Electrocorticography (ECoG) signals and modern deep learning techniques, integrated with the MuJoCo physics simulator.

## Project Overview

This project explores the development of a real-time Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system. The goal is to decode motor intentions from Electrocorticography (ECoG) signals using deep learning, and then use these decoded commands to control a simulated robotic arm within the MuJoCo physics environment.

This is an exploratory project focused on building a functional proof-of-concept.

## Key Project Areas

* **ECoG Data Processing:** Preprocessing and feature extraction from raw ECoG signals.
* **Deep Learning Decoding:** Designing and training neural networks (e.g., CNNs, LSTMs) to predict kinematic movements.
* **Robotics Integration:** Real-time control of a MuJoCo arm model based on decoded brain signals.

## Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**
* **MuJoCo** (Physics simulator)
* **MNE-Python** (ECoG data processing)
* **PyTorch** (Deep Learning framework)
* `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib` (Numerical computing & plotting)

## Getting Started

Further details on installation, data acquisition, and project setup will be provided as the project progresses.
